# TaCo App

This app aims at creating a simple and easy to use app that can help visually impaired people in their day to day lives. It introduces two groundbreaking features to 
enhance user independence and ease of use

## NFC Tag Identification:

Quickly and effortlessly identify everyday objects with the NFC tag feature. From spice boxes to clothing, simply tag your items, and the app will instantly read or write 
information, making it easier to keep track of personal belongings.

Spatial Audio and Head Tracking (Beta):

For improved navigation and help locating things I have introduced a navigation method which (currently) uses spatial audio, integrated with head tracking technology. 
This feature provides real-time spatial sound cues, helping you orient yourself and navigate your surroundings with greater confidence. And more improvements to come in this area

Whatâ€™s Coming Next:

Future updates will bring full navigation support using spatial audio augmented with visual feed from the camera

## TaCo Wire Frame

As described before the app is supposed to be simple and easy to use. Plus as it is clearly for visually impaired people 
I am using HUGEE buttons
